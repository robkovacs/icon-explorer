## Must
* Turn the inspector into a modal window (ðŸ˜±) on smaller viewports
* Fix sorting of icons (again...): one-word icons come first, but the rest are backwards
* The logo icons aren't _actually_ customâ€”think of a better way to describe their source

## Should
* Add a clear button to the search field, when the value is not blank

## Could
* Add a "list" view, to go with the current "grid" view, that lists out all the details of every icon in a single shot; include a toggle between the two
* Clean up CSS
* Clean up JS

## Not sure
* Set size and color props, so that you could...
    * Copy Figma component to clipboard
    * Copy React import statement and/or React component to clipboard; show code snippet

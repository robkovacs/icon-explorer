# Must
* Turn the inspector into a modal window (ðŸ˜±) on smaller viewports
* Fix sorting of icons (again) â€” one-word icons come first, but the rest are backwards

# Should
* Add a clear button to the search field, when the value is not blank

# Could
* Add a "list" view, to go with the current "grid" view, that lists out all the details of every icon in a single shot; include a toggle between the two
* Clean up CSS
* Clean up JS

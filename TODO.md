## Must
- [ ] Turn the inspector into a modal window (ðŸ˜±) on smaller viewports
- [x] Fix sorting of icons (again...): one-word icons come first, but the rest are backwards
- [x] The logo icons aren't _actually_ customâ€”think of a better way to describe their source
- [ ] Find a more permanent place to host this

## Should
- [ ] Add a clear button to the search field, when the value is not blank
- [x] Replace browser-default focus states with Milo-style focus states
- [x] Add hover state on the search field

## Could
- [ ] Add a "list" view, to go with the current "grid" view, that lists out all the details of every icon in a single shot; include a toggle between the two

## Forever true, tbh ðŸ˜…
- [ ] Clean up CSS 
- [ ] Clean up JS

## Not sure
- [ ] Set size and color props, so that you could...
    - [ ] Copy Figma component to clipboard
    - [ ] Copy React import statement and/or React component to clipboard; show code snippet
